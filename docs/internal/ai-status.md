## 2026-05-25 - Shared review narrative and impact projection
- State: Done
- Scope: rust/src/commands/review_contract.rs; rust/src/commands/access/access_plan_tui.rs; rust/src/commands/access/access_plan_types.rs; docs/internal/tui-architecture-roadmap.md
- Current Update: Moved access plan narrative and impact row projection into the shared review contract so mutation review surfaces can reuse action/status/changed-field guidance text.
- Result: Access plan TUI keeps the same Narrative and Why this matters rows while review_contract now owns the generic action narrative and changed-field impact projection. Public CLI paths, help text, generated docs, and command contracts are unchanged.

## 2026-05-25 - Shared review context projection
- State: Done
- Scope: rust/src/commands/review_contract.rs; rust/src/commands/access/access_plan_tui.rs; docs/internal/tui-architecture-roadmap.md
- Current Update: Moved access plan warning and blocker context row projection into the shared review contract so mutation review surfaces can reuse blocked reasons, safe warning changed fields, and blocked target flag evidence.
- Result: Access plan TUI keeps the same Blocked context, Warning context, and Blocked evidence rows while review_contract now owns the generic warning/blocker context projection for mutation actions. Public CLI paths, help text, generated docs, and command contracts are unchanged.

## 2026-05-25 - Shared review target evidence projection
- State: Done
- Scope: rust/src/commands/review_contract.rs; rust/src/commands/access/access_plan_tui.rs; docs/internal/tui-architecture-roadmap.md
- Current Update: Moved access plan live-target evidence row projection into the shared review contract so mutation review surfaces can reuse known target field rows.
- Result: Access plan TUI keeps the same Live target: key=value rows while review_contract now owns the known target field projection for generic mutation actions. Public CLI paths, help text, generated docs, and command contracts are unchanged.

## 2026-05-25 - Shared review change-detail projection
- State: Done
- Scope: rust/src/commands/review_contract.rs; rust/src/commands/access/access_plan_tui.rs; docs/internal/tui-architecture-roadmap.md
- Current Update: Moved access plan action change-detail row projection into the shared review contract so mutation review surfaces can reuse safe Change: field bundle/live rows.
- Result: Access plan TUI keeps the same Change: field bundle/live rows while the reusable review contract now owns safe changed-field filtering and compact value formatting for generic mutation action changes. Public CLI paths, help text, generated docs, and command contracts are unchanged.

## 2026-05-25 - Shared review diff preview projection
- State: Done
- Scope: rust/src/commands/review_contract.rs; rust/src/commands/access/access_plan_tui.rs; docs/internal/tui-architecture-roadmap.md
- Current Update: Moved access plan action diff-preview line projection into the shared review contract so mutation review surfaces can reuse safe live/desired preview rows.
- Result: Access plan TUI keeps the same shared diff preview output and secret-like field filtering while the reusable review contract now owns the generic action changes to ReviewDiffModel preview projection. Public CLI paths, help text, generated docs, and command contracts are unchanged.

## 2026-05-25 - Shared review next-check projection
- State: Done
- Scope: rust/src/commands/review_contract.rs; rust/src/commands/access/access_plan_tui.rs; docs/internal/tui-architecture-roadmap.md
- Current Update: Moved access plan action next-check line projection into the shared review contract so TUI review surfaces can reuse hint/default follow-up guidance.
- Result: Access plan interactive reviews now consume shared review-contract next-check lines while preserving existing hint, blocker, warning, create/update/delete, and no-op guidance strings. Public CLI paths, help text, generated docs, and command contracts are unchanged.
